# WPMCounter
NW.js based WPM counter using iohook.

NW.js: https://nwjs.io/

iohook: https://github.com/wilix-team/iohook

Currently in development. 

##Testing requirements are NW.js, and npm.

From project directory:
```bash
npm install
```
then (Linux)
```bash
/path/to/nw .
```
or (Windows)
```powershell
\path\to\nw.exe .
```
On Windows, you can also just drag the folder containing package.json (the project folder) to nw.exe to run the app.
